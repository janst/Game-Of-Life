## Game Of Life - a javascript version
This is the result of playing with Javascript for a little while. It is my first Javascript project
so don't expect it to follow all best practices ...

Game Of Life is a zero-player cellular automaton game devised by the British mathematician John Horton 
Conway in 1970. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing 
how it evolves.

The application is written in Javascript, the HTML5 canvas element is used for the grid, the game 
logic is developed using TDD with Jasmine and the user interface is based on JQuery UI.

## Usage
Open the GameOfLife.html file in a web browser. Choose a pattern, set a resolution, set a loop time 
and press Start. Live [demo](http://gameoflife2012.appspot.com/).
